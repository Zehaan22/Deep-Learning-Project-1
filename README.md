# Deep-Learning-Project-1

## Aim

The aim of this project is to explore the mathematical concepts behinf Machine Learning and Deep Learing.

## Introduction to the project

This application porvides an interactive user-interface that allows the user to draw Hindi Numerals on a black slate and uses a trained-from-scratch ML model to recognise the digit that is drawn on the slate. This technology can find multiple applications such as :

- Teaching young kids Hindi digits
- Future text recognition for various ethic languages
- Eliminating the barrier between both technologically backward and Non-English speaking individuals, and the modern work flow.

## Structure of the files

The Program Files are divided into two main folders, namely:

1. GUI:
   <br>
   The files that deal with the UI/UX aspect of the application.
2. Backend:
   <br>
   The files that comprise of the backend workings of the app.
   This would include both the training and testing of the model and the data handeling files

The final folder is the Data folder that contains the data files used to train our data.
